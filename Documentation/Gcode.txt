Beweging X/Y-as:
- G0 for Rapid Move
- G1 for Linear Move

G0 Xnnn Ynnn Fnnn (X-as, Y-as, Feedrate (mm/minute))
Feedrate should only be set once based on the desired speed.
G1 Ennn (Extrude mm)

G28 Move to home positie (X:0, Y:0)

M18 turn off motors

M82 to set the printer in absolute mode, this means that you have to tell to which coordinate the printer needs to move.
M83 sets the printer in relative mode, this means that the printer will move with the given value based on it's current position.

The printer currently has it's dimensions set to 2000x2000mm, this because the motors still need to be calibrated.

G92 sets the current position to the values specified

M92 to change steps per unit.

M114 (D): Information about current position, parameter D gives a more detailed description.

M119: Endstop status
M120: Enable endstops
M121: Disable endstops

M211 S(0|1) Software endstop status (On/Off), requires either MIN_SOFTWARE_ENDSTOPS or MAX_SOFTWARE_ENDSTOPS for the enable option.

M302       ; Report current state
M302 P1    ; Allow cold extrusion
M302 S120 R110 ; Allow extrusion starting from 120°C and retractions already from 110°C
M302 S0    ; Allow extrusion at any temperature
M302 S170  ; Allow extrusion above 170

M500 needs to be enabled in the firmware, used to save current settings to EEPROM
M501 to change the EEPROM settings back to what is saved, useful when experimenting with different settings
M502 to reset all EEPROM settings.
M503 to read all settings.
M504 checks if the EEPROM has the correct version and sends it back to the user.

ToDo:
-Calibrate steps for X/Y-axis motors
-Acceleration, Pulse/rev, Jerk, RPM (prusa calculators)
-Figure out how to approach building and calibrating the Z-axis
